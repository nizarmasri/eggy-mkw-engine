# Eggy's changes to WiiCompiled for the web

This fork is the engine behind Mario Kart Wii in Eggy (a private party-game app
for a group of friends). It is `dynamiteswag81/webcompiled`'s `web-port` (the
browser port of `patchzyy/Wiicompiled`), with the changes below. Eggy's own
code goes in new files where it can; every change to an upstream file is
listed here so an upstream merge knows what to keep.

The repository never holds game data. Eggy builds the game in its private data
repository from a pinned commit of this one.

## Changes to upstream files

| File | Change | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `web/js/library_mkw_dvd.js` | `Module.mkwDiscSource`: when the page supplies `{manifest(mount), read(mount, relPath, offset, length)}`, the disc manifest and every read come from it instead of HTTP. | Eggy serves the disc as content-addressed 1 MiB chunks cached on the phone chunk by chunk, so a dropped connection or a closed page resumes where it stopped. |
| `web/tests/web_disc_node_host.mjs`, `web/tests/run_web_disc_test.mjs` | A third Node run of the disc test through `mkwDiscSource`. | Proves the supplied source behaves exactly like the HTTP path (missing files, truncation, odd names). |

## Added

- `.github/workflows/eggy.yml`: the web disc test on every push (Node, JSPI, no game data).
